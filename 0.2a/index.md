# Warsow 0.2a

Warsow 0.2 alpha was released in May 2003. According to the changelog, it is the second release.
It's a very early version. The models are not very detailed, but the wall jump is already there!
There are only 2 original maps: wtest1 and wtest2. At this point, the game ships with a few maps from Quake 3's CPM (Challenge Pro Mod).
